Beautiful experience sharing web-site:-

You're my lifeline, the most special and important person in my life, when I say I need it's because I see you more than just a friend you are my best friend, my soulmate, my happiness, no matter what happens "You will always be my LifeLine, my everything", I never thought of replacing you, I never thought of having someone better in my life because for me you are the best you know what I need you make me smile you make me feel special, I'm afraid that someday I may lose you to someone else because I irritate you a lot, because sometimes I'm a mess and I get angry, jealous, possessive, I'm sorry but it's just that I'm so happy having you in my life I just dont want to let you go, I need you close, I need you forever because for me "You're my lifeline & I love you Heer ❤
Whenever we meet that day is special to me...! And that special day date is my password...
